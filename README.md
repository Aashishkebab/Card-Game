# Card-Game
A card game that I made for a Computer Science project.

INSTRUCTIONS:

You are facing an AI in a card game. The objective is to get four of the same value cards (i.e. four 7s), regardless of card suite.

You start off by drawing a card. You then discard one of your five cards so that you only have four left. Then the computer moves. And on and on until someone has four of the same card.
